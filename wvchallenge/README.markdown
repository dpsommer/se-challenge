## Setup

If python/pip are not installed - run ```$ sudo runserver.sh```.
Otherwise, run ```$ runserver.sh -s```.

Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

If running manually, use --insecure so static files are served.

## Implementation

The application is easy to set up and run, and the internal logic is straightforward.
